### Welcome Traveler
#### Let me introduce myself, my name is BlindBoko and I'm the master and CEO of this Profile.

Jokes aside, hello, I am Blindboko from El Salvador, I am an avid fan of videogames and sports alike, and also an aspiring game developer. Currently still in high-school, I've been learning how to code on my spare time, I enjoy developing games, I am yet to finish one, but I like replicating mechanics of games or just replicating the whole gameplay.

## Skills:
- C# = 90f;
